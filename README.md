# ADA: Lifetime Value Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains code and notebooks designed to guide you through predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for different customer cohorts. You'll learn how to apply models for CLV prediction using a dataset from Wedge Grocery Store and practice analyzing customer segments from Dram Shop.

The project is structured into three parts:
1. **`slides-code.py`**: This Python file contains code transcribed from the assigned [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=486x8ccQThE) on CLV prediction. It demonstrates how to build and fit a CLV model using real customer transaction data.
2. **`dram-example.ipynb`**: In this notebook, you will apply the CLV model to a segment of customers from the Dram Shop. The notebook walks through the steps of loading data, fitting models, and interpreting results. In this example we'll predict sales over the next three months from these Dram customers. 
3. **`wedge-ltv.ipynb`**: This notebook is the core of your assignment. You will work with your Wedge data. , which spans from January 1, 2010, through January 31, 2017. Your goal will be to predict customer activity over the last 13 months, using the data up to the end of 2015 to build the model.
